          HALETHORPE, Md. — The athletes, barking steadily, strain against their
          leashes toward the racing field. Their trainers, clad in team
          T-shirts, make final preparations: Do I have the string cheese in my
          pocket as a finish-line treat? Do I have his ll, grabbing the ball and
          dashing back over the hurdles with it. Flyball, a sport in which
          four-dog teams compete in a carefully choreographed relay race, is a
          weekend ritual for many people, as sacrosanct as youth soccer or
          bowling leagues are to others. Aside from the occasional ribbon,
          trophy or title that its recipient cannot fully appreciate (“Iron Do
          and their pets.

          “Once you work with a dog, that bonds the two of you to a whole other
          level,” said Dr. Peter J. Lotsikas, a veterinarian and founder of
          Skylos Sports Medicine of Maryland, which specializes in treating
          orthopedic problems in dogs. Most of his patients participate in
          sports like Flyball, al, there has to be a higher level of
          communication there — it’s amazing once you feel it click.”

          At a tournament held here in August at the Oriole Dog Training Club —
          which, like many Flyball facilities, is in an industrial warehouse —
          people said they had gravitated to Flyball because it is the only team
          sport for dogs. It is also the only one in which the dogs are allowed
          to bark as freely as they want, which brings joy to the dogs (and
          prompts D’Ascoli, a dog groomer from Laytonsville, Md., who was racing
          her Boston terrier, Bertha, at the tournament here. “It’s a special
          bond.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Bertha is her fourth Flyball racer; her first was an Australian
          Shepherd, a breed of herding dog known for its friskiness. “You get a
          high-energy dog like that, and you have to do something with him,” Ms.
          D’Ascoli said. “He was too fast for agility, for me — he was ripping
          through the course, and I couldn’t keep up with him.” This led her to
          Flyball.

          Flubs are frequent. At the tournament here, several dogs dropped their
          balls before reaching the finish line, and some ran outside the
          hurdles or knocked them down. Part of the training ret helped the dog
          perform at its best,” said Rose A. Kane, secretary of the tournament
          hosted here.
