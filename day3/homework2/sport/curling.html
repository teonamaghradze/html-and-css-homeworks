          GANGNEUNG, South Korea — Ever since the International Olympic
          Committee added curling to its official list of winter sports in time
          for the 1998 Winter Olympic Games, the sport has been a quadrennial
          source of curiosity — and e suggest otherwise — deliver polished
          granite orbs across a long sheet of ice. They use special brooms and
          wear special shoes and have their own special language, barking
          commands like “hurry hard!” Canadians, in particular, love this stuff.
          Here in Pyeongchang, curling will clutter the calendar for 18 full
          days — longer than any other sport at the Games. Mixed doubles
          actually starts Thursday, the day before the opening ceremony. There
          will be no shortage of hurrying hard this month. So as we dive back
          into the madness, a quick primer might be in order.
        </p>

        <h3>Without getting too technical, how do you play?</h3>
        <p>
          Let’s start with the men’s and women’s team events. There are four
          players on each team, who rotate jobs. But for each throw, one player
          delivers the rock — the aforementioned granite stone, which weighs
          between 38 and 42 pounds — two teammates sweep and the fourth person
          sets the target. The target is at the other end of the sheet. Known as
          the house, it’s a series of concentric circles that forms a sort of
          bull’s-eye.
        </p>

        <h3>So, how do you score?</h3>

        <p>
          Each match takes place over 10 ends, which are kind of like innings in
          baseball. A total of 16 rocks — eight per team — are thrown during
          each end, and the teams alternate shots. One of the quirks of curling
          is that only one team can score in each end, and that point goes to
          the team that puts a rock closesngle end, that’s a huge score and
          often amounts to an insurmountable lead.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, that's not to say that the physical game is no longer
          important; in fact, it's quite the opposite. With the extremely wide
          variety of playing conditions encountered by bowlers today, a
          consistent and versatile physical game is a prerequisite for bowling
          success! That's why we continue to devote a significant portion of our
          coe footwork, the release, timing, balance, and the armswing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, it might be worth familiarizing yourself with the term “hammer.”
          The team with the hammer gets to throw the last rock, which is a huge
          tacticad not score in the previous end. Simple, right? Thought so. In
          any case, there’s a ton of strategy involved, especially in the early
          portions of ends as teams set up their stones ahead of a flurry of
          late action in hopes of scoring as many points as possible. Why do
          curlers turn the handle just before they rethe sheet. So to control
          that curl, players give the handle a little turn — either clockwise or
          counterclockwise. They must release the handle before they reached a
          horizontal stripe called the hog line.
