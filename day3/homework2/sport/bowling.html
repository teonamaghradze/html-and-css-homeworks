              Today's top bowlers, pro shop operators, and coaches need access
              to the best information in order to be at their best. Sometimes,
              just one key tip or new technique can mean the difference between
              success and failure. That's why we strive to deliver the absolute
              best bowling instructional material available anywhere.

              Today, we’ll take a look at how the Strokes arrived at their sound
              and how their chart-topping debut took shape. In the process, I’ll
              point out some of the gear they used and the methods behind the
              album’s controlled chaos. Since I wasn’t in the booth with Gordon
              and the Strokes, I’ve relied on the few written accounts of the
              recording sessions along with other supplemental material. I’ve
              listed my sources at the end of this article.

              The modern sport of bowling requires mastery of so much more than
              just the physical game. Today's top bowlers can only be at their
              best by having in-depth knowledge in a wide variety of
              bowling-related topics. Bowling balls, drilling and layouts, the
              mental game, health and fitness, lane play, ball motion,
              coverstocks, oil pattern transition, and arsenal selection are all
              now critical components for bowling success at the highest levels.
              All of these important topics are covered regularly by Bowling
              This Month.

          Of course, that's not to say that the physical game is no longer
          important; in fact, it's quite the opposite. With the extremely wide
          variety of playing conditions encountered by bowlers today, a
          consistent and versatile physical game is a prerequisite for bowling
          success! That's why we continue to devote a significant portion of our
          content on the physical game, including the latest in biomechanical
          research for bowlers, analyses of the various styles that make up the
          modern game, and all the standard physical game topics like footwork,
          the release, timing, balance, and the armswing.
