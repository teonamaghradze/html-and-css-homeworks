          The year 2021 marks the 20th anniversary of Is This It, the debut
          album from the Strokes. The album’s unflinchingly unique sound and the
          somewhat edgy image of the band contributed to something of a
          revolution in the alternative-music space. Some called it a rebirth of
          rock and roll in New York City; others called it the newest
          incarnation of the Velvet Underground. Regardless, Is This It has a
          few hallmarks that set it apart from its contemporaries. Among them
          are the dueling guitars of Albert Hammond Jr. and Nick Valensi, both
          swapping rhythm and lead duties from verse to chorus. The groove is
          held down by Nikolai Fraiture’s sensible bass lines and Fabrizio
          Moretti’s airtight drumming. Perhaps most impactful of all is the
          distinctive voice and slightly charred sound of the front man, Julian
          Casablancas.

          Today, we’ll take a look at how the Strokes arrived at their sound and
          how their chart-topping debut took shape. In the process, I’ll point
          out some of the gear they used and the methods behind the album’s
          controlled chaos. Since I wasn’t in the booth with Gordon and the
          Strokes, I’ve relied on the few written accounts of the recording
          sessions along with other supplemental material. I’ve listed my
          sources at the end of this article.

        <h3>Recording The Modern Age</h3>
        <p>
          Before being catapulted to the world stage, the Strokes would meet
          Gordon Raphael, owner and engineer at the Manhattan-based
          Transporterraum. Located in Manhattan, Raphael’s basement studio
          featured a single 888 interface with just eight mic inputs. For The
          Modern Age, Raphael opted for a quick and dirty approach — three mics
          on the drums, one mic for each guitar and bass, and a room mic. That
          left one mic for vocals. They set up in the live room and recorded all
          the takes as a full band.

        <p>
          The 11-minute EP was a chaotic, in-your-face introduction to the world
          — precisely the desired effect. The Modern Age became an
          almost-instant hit and got scooped up by Rough Trade. Critical
          reception was glowing. NME named the record their single of the week,
          saying, “. . . The Strokes aren’t just a sound perfectly preserved in
          retro aspic. They’re the latest in a thrilling line of American bands
          reinvigorating rock with taut guitar lines, stunning dynamics and
          great hair.”

        <h3>Returning to the Basement</h3>
        <p>
          After the band signed with RCA, they elected to start recording with
          Grammy Award-winning producer Gil Norton (Pixies, Foo Fighters,
          Counting Crows). After recording three songs, the band scrapped the
          sessions, calling the sound too polished and pretentious. They left
          Norton’s high-end studio and returned to Gordon Raphael and the
          Transporterraum, which was on the brink of foreclosure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though it was located in a basement, Transporterraum had a
          distinct sound that Norton’s studio lacked. The live room was roughly
          25 feet square with 12-foot-tall ceilings and homemade acoustic
          treatment. All in all, the studio had the perfect vibe for a band like
          the Strokes. It was here that the band would spend six weeks getting
          to know Gordon Raphael — rehearsing, partying, and recording one of
          the most important rock records of 2001.
