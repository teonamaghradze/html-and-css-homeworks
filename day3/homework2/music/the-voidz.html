        <p>
          A year since the Strokes' last LP and almost five years since his solo
          debut, Julian Casablancas has shed some light on his forthcoming
          project with his new band, the Voidz. Entitled, Can I VHS you? and
          shot like a shaky handheld You've Been Framed clip – with not an
          inebriated granny at a wedding in sight, unfortunately – the video
          features an interview with the Strokes frontman in the front seat of a
          Monte Carlo, as well as rehearsal footage from their first show in
          Washington and bursts of the band's material. So far it sounds
          noisier, wirier and tuned to the dirgey punk rock of 1970s New York.
          "There's a lot of in-between areas in music that haven't been
          exploited," the singer begins, "and it's trying to become that gap."
        </p>

        <h3>What will the album sound like?</h3>
        <p>
          "Jazz and punk – amazing melodic things and flavours" "Music of our
          time" "World sounding with a lot of power"
        </p>

        <h3>What does it all mean?</h3>
        <p>
          "[It's] a protest record. I try and keep it subtle and universal but
          it is pretty sad I guess, that there seems to be no way around
          corruption being king now and forever and always. "I felt like the
          best cool things are never cool in their time. It always takes years.
          It almost has a political parallel, like truth in politics: 30 years
          later people will say 'yeah slavery is terrible' but when it's
          happening in their day it's just clueless."
        </p>

        <p>
          No further details regarding the album are available yet. Julian
          Casablancas will be performing both with the Voidz and the Strokes at
          the Governors Ball music festival in New York City in June.
