              " For an indie song, this definitely has one of the greatest
              guitar riffs. I'd even put it up there with Seven Nation Army and
              Smoke on the Water."
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              "Best band. Best song. In all seriousness, the only problem with
              it is the fact that it doesn't go for 6 minutes. Few songs have
              this level of genius in them."
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              "Great song, incredible riff. Makes me want to jump and scream.
              One of the best bands in the world"

            <blockquote>
              "By far the greatest song EVER made by the band, absolutely a
              masterpiece. With its hip the song to a maximal climax. Absolutely
              one of the best songs of the 21st century."
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              "It's very hard to compare all of their songs, it's a fact. I'm
              very torned between all of their hits but I've got to say, this
              song nging, this song just explodes itself with probability to
              become even better. THE STROKES 4 LYF!"
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              "I love this song. It has to be by far the best Strokes song. It
              really gives off there mellow sounding tone to the song. From the
              guitar in the beginning to Julian's voice, it fits in just about
              every part of The Strokes."

              "Not only is ths song umbeat and addicting, the lyrics are
              meaningful and deep! Hearing this song for the first time a long
              time ago, I wasn't expecting this. You Live Only Once has awesome
              guitar riffs and speaks the truth. The Strokes, keep up the good
              work!"
