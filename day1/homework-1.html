      <b>HTML</b> 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first
      version developed and standardized exclusively by the <b>W3C</b>, as the
      <b>IETF</b> had closed its <b>HTML Working Group</b> on September 12,
      1996.
      <br />
      â€‹Initially code-named "Wilbur", <b>HTML</b> 3.2 dropped math formulas
      entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and
      adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags.
      <i><b>Netscape' s blink</b></i>
      element and <i><b>Microsoft' s blink</b></i> marquee element were omitted
      due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not
      standardized until 14 months later in MathML.
