In 1980, physicist [**Tim Berners-Lee**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee), a contractor at [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN), proposed and prototyped [ENQUIRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE), a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.

## January 14, 1997

**HTML** 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the **W3C**, as the **IETF** had closed its **HTML** **Working** **Group** on September 12, 1996.
​Initially code-named "Wilbur", **HTML** 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. **_Netscape's blink_** element and **_Microsoft's_** marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.

A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.
